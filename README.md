# Library

A Library website that lets you manage your personal collection of books on various topics. You can add new books by entering their title, author, and number of pages, or delete books you no longer want. You can also mark books as read or unread, and see your reading progress and statistics. The website has a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy to find and organize your books.

This version of the website uses arrays as a temporary way of storing data in memory. In the future, I plan to update it to use local storage, which will allow the data to persist across browser sessions and devices. This will make the website more reliable and convenient for users.
